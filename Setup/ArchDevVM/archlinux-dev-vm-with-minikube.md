# DEV setup

## Deploy Guest Archlinux VM with Vagrant 

1. In `C:\HashiCorp\Vagrant\embedded\gems\2.2.7\gems\vagrant-2.2.7\plugins\provisioners\salt\bootstrap-salt.sh`. 
Add `--insecure` to curl. Restart machine and ensure connected to internet.
2. Dev VM available [here](https://github.com/scoulomb/dev_vm?organization=scoulomb&organization=scoulomb) (use your own fork).
    - Clone dev_vm into dev directory in windows `HOME/dev` (`C:\Users\$USER\dev`) using git bash:
        - `mkdir dev`
        - `git clone https://github.com/scoulomb/dev_vm.git`
    - Make modifications in DEV VM repo:
        * `cd dev_vm`
        * `./sync_fork.sh` to sync with central
        * In `vagrantfile`: 
            * Change vagrant `$USER` in sync folder
            * Eventually adapt CPU and RAM,and port forwarding (`1313` for kubedoc)
        * In  `saltstack/salt/common/git/gitconfig`: Change username and mail, and editor
        * In `saltstack/salt/common/fish/fish_variables`: Change user variable and potentially `KUBE_EDITOR` and `EDITOR`
    - You can keep your custom change in a [custom branch](https://github.com/scoulomb/dev_vm/tree/custom):
    `git checkout -b custom; git add --all;  git ci -m "Custom"; git push --set-upstream origin custom`
    Then do `git co master`, `./sync_fork.sh` and `git co custom; git rebase master`.
    
3. Start the VM: `vagrant up; vagrant ssh`

You could have some package (download) error. 
In that case re-run the provisioner:

## Start/Delete Minikube

````buildoutcfg
sudo minikube start --vm-driver=none
sudo minikube delete
````
 
For deletion to work you may have to `sudo chmod 770 /tmp`.
If error (like certificate), delete minikube et start it again.

Run a pod:

````buildoutcfg
[22:27] ~
‚û§ k run alpine --image alpine --restart=Never -- /bin/sleep 10                                                                                                                vagrant@archlinux

````

*Note*:
This does not install last version of Kubectl. 
It installs `1.14` whereas in exploration below it was `1.18`.
This impacts (Both tested):
- [Kubectl run](../../Master-Kubectl/0-kubectl-run-explained.md) and [appendices](../../Master-Kubectl/1-kubectl-create-explained-ressource-derived-from-pod.md).
- [Security psp extensions](../../Security/0-capabilities-bis-part3-psp-tutorial.md#create-role)

Even if [Kubectl](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/kubectl/) `1.18` is availabe.
The VM image we are using does not use it because it an older snapshot.
A new snapshot was requested [here](https://github.com/archlinux/arch-boxes/issues/100).
We faced some issues when using it.

## Misc

### DNS issue 

For instance when doing `oc login` on external PAAS.
Do `sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches`

### Minikube start in provisioning

For download. Excluded as not always needed but possible as done for `oc` download. 

<details><summary>Minikube manual setup and exploration</summary>
<p>

## Setup Kubernetes on this dev machine - Manual and deprecated procedure  

This setup is now automated and simplified in VM provision.
See https://github.com/Jiehong/dev_vm/pull/1 (and comments in vim and editor, when unset default is vi for k8s (k edit) and vim for git (commit window)).



### Setup yaourt package manager

I realized later that Aura is already there but all tuto I found for minikube are with yaourt!
Moreover Minikube is in community. It is possible to install it as well as other package with `Pacman -s`
So we did this in provisioner.
Follow this tuto: https://cloudcone.com/docs/article/install-packages-in-arch-linux-from-aur/ (Section > "install yaout using AUR")

````
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel git wget yajl
sudo git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/package-query.git # Add sudo
cd package-query/ # May need to perform chmod
makepkg -si
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yaourt.git
cd yaourt/
makepkg -si
````
### Install minikube

````
yaourt -S minikube
sudo minikube start --vm-driver=none
````

This failed thus I Followed this procedure: https://www.howtoforge.com/learning-kubernetes-locally-via-minikube-on-linux-manjaro-archlinux/

````
sudo pacman -Sy libvirt qemu ebtables dnsmasq

sudo usermod -a -G libvirt $(whoami)
newgrp libvirt

sudo systemctl start libvirtd.service
sudo systemctl enable libvirtd.service
 
sudo systemctl start virtlogd.service
sudo systemctl enable virtlogd.service

sudo pacman -Sy docker-machine
yaourt -Sy docker-machine-driver-kvm2

yaourt -Sy minikube-bin kubectl-bin
````

If error re-run the command, conflcit with existing ERASE (kubectl, docker already there as deployed with Salt. Added git)


### Trying minkube (and the different driver)

#### kvm driver [Not working]

when launching minikube driver error with kvm because of nested virtulization
https://github.com/minishift/minishift/issues/3075
Thus previous install could have been simplfied 

#### Docker  driver [Certificate issue]

so use docker driver

and magic happens 
https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/docker/

````
‚û§ minikube start --driver=docker                                                                                                                                              vagrant@archlinuxüòÑ  minikube v1.9.2 on Arch  (vbox/amd64)

````

But when launching a pod, I had a pull isse

````
  Normal   Pulling      7s (x2 over 20s)  kubelet, minikube  Pulling image "nginx"
  Warning  Failed       6s (x2 over 20s)  kubelet, minikube  Failed to pull image "nginx": rpc error: code = Unknown desc = Error response from daemon: Get https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority
  Warning  Failed       6s (x2 over 20s)  kubelet, minikube  Error: ErrImagePull
[23:03] ~
````

This is due to certificate issue but they are already deployed with Salt...
In doubt I re-used this proc https://github.com/scoulomb/myk8s/blob/master/Setup/MinikubeSetup/insecureCertificate.sh

Except need had to `mkdir /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/` and cmd is ` sudo update-ca-trust` with Archlinux.
Then I restart minikube but issue still there.

It is because insecure registry is correct in VM docker setup but not in the driver (kVM running in archlinux VM) 
Here is a proof

Exit root and define some aliases:

And try with fish

Doing kubectl auto completions id not working with `bash -c`.


### Define permanenent fish helper (with sudo access to kubecltl and autocompletion)

Objective is to type:
- just type `k` for `sudo kubectl` # as need to be sudo for `none` driver
- And at the same type benefit for autocompetion

Equivalent to this in bash:
https://github.com/scoulomb/myk8s/blob/master/Setup/MinikubeSetup/setupBash.sh

#### Install an editor

https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vim-vi/: `yaourt -Sy vim-vi`.

#### Write fish function for dummies

Locate function here `cd ~/.config/fish`
Source not needed if fish restart
However for function to be sourced at fish start make 1 func per file, with file name == func name

Some basics: https://github.com/razzius/fish-functions/blob/master/functions/any-arguments.fish

#### Basic fish functions

````
echo 'function minikube_reset
   sudo minikube delete
   sudo minikube start --driver=none
   #alias k=\'sudo kubectl\'
end' >  ~/.config/fish/functions/minikube_reset.fish

echo 'function kgpo
   sudo kubectl get pods
end' >  ~/.config/fish/functions/kgpo.fish
````

#### Aliases with autocompletion

##### Auto-completion

I will use the [`kubectl.fish`](https://gist.github.com/terlar/28e1c2e4ac9a27be7a5950306bf45ab2).
And copy it here `~/.config/fish/functions/kubectl.fish`.

##### Aliasing

###### Bad solution

This will not work with autocompeltion
````
echo 'function kk
   eval sudo kubectl $argv
end' >  kk.fish

```` 
This needs to ne run every session

````
function k_alias
    alias k='sudo kubectl'
end
````
##### Best solution

From https://gist.github.com/tikolakin/d59b4fc87c0af9720d0d

````
alias k='sudo kubectl'  
funcsave k
````

this will create k.fish
